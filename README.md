### Hello world, I'm Gabriel

I recently graduated from New Jersey Institude of Technology with a degree in Web & Information Systems with a minor in Information Technology. I'm passionate about technology and eager to start my career in web development.

As a student, I've developed skills in:
* JavaScript ( React.js, Next.js)
* CSS (TailwindCSS, SCSS)
* Python
* PHP
* Java
* C#
* Coldfusion
* and even HTML!
I've worked on several projects, which you can see here on my GitHub.

As a part-time junior developer, I have maintained and enhanced various legacy systems using PHP-based CMS templates. These would be found here, should they become public: [My Work Account](https://github.com/geJDV)

Iâ€™m currently learning more about Docker and Typescript, as well as everything mentioned above, as I believe in continuous learning and improvement.

I am actively seeking opportunities where I can both contribute and grow within a forward-thinking team. I am particularly interested in positions that provide substantial learning experiences to further build my repertoire.
